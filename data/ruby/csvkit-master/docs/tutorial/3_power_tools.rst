csvjoin: merging related data
=============================

One of the most common operations that we need to perform on data is "joining" it to other, related data. For instance, given a dataset about equipment supplied to counties in Nebraska, one might reasonably want to merge that with a dataset containing the population of each county. :doc:`/scripts/csvjoin` allows us to take two those two datasets (equipment and population) and merge them, much like you might do with a SQL ``JOIN`` query. In order to demonstrate this, let's grab a second dataset::

    $ curl -L -O https://github.com/onyxfish/csvkit/raw/master/examples/realdata/acs2012_5yr_population.csv

Now let's see what's in there::

    $ csvstat acs2012_5yr_population.csv
      1. fips
            <type 'int'>
            Nulls: False
            Min: 31001
            Max: 31185
            Sum: 2891649
            Mean: 31093.0
            Median: 31093
            Standard Deviation: 53.6904709112
            Unique values: 93
      2. name
            <type 'unicode'>
            Nulls: False
            Unique values: 93
            Max length: 23
      3. total_population
            <type 'int'>
            Nulls: False
            Min: 348
            Max: 518271
            Sum: 1827306
            Mean: 19648.4516129
            Median: 6294
            Standard Deviation: 62164.0702096
            Unique values: 93
      4. margin_of_error
            <type 'int'>
            Nulls: False
            Min: 0
            Max: 115
            Sum: 1800
            Mean: 19.3548387097
            Median: 0
            Standard Deviation: 37.6927719494
            Unique values: 15
            5 most frequent values:
                    0:      73
                    115:    2
                    114:    2
                    99:     2
                    73:     2

    Row count: 93

As you can see, this data file contains population estimates for each county in Nebraska from the 2012 5-year ACS estimates. This data was retrieved from `Census Reporter <http://censusreporter.org/>`_ and reformatted slightly for this example. Let's join it to our equipment data::

    $ csvjoin -c fips data.csv acs2012_5yr_population.csv > joined.csv

Since both files contain a fips column, we can use that to join the two. In our output you should see the population data appended at the end of each row of data. Let's combine this with what we've learned before to answer the question "What was the lowest population county to receive equipment?"::

    $ csvcut -c county,item_name,total_population joined.csv | csvsort -c total_population | csvlook | head
    |-------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------|
    |  county     | item_name                                                      | total_population  |
    |-------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------|
    |  MCPHERSON  | RIFLE,5.56 MILLIMETER                                          | 348               |
    |  WHEELER    | RIFLE,5.56 MILLIMETER                                          | 725               |
    |  GREELEY    | RIFLE,7.62 MILLIMETER                                          | 2515              |
    |  GREELEY    | RIFLE,7.62 MILLIMETER                                          | 2515              |
    |  GREELEY    | RIFLE,7.62 MILLIMETER                                          | 2515              |
    |  NANCE      | RIFLE,5.56 MILLIMETER                                          | 3730              |
    |  NANCE      | RIFLE,7.62 MILLIMETER                                          | 3730              |

Two counties with fewer than one-thousand residents were the recipients of 5.56 millimeter assault rifles. This simple example demonstrates the power of joining datasets. Although SQL will always be a more flexible option, ``csvjoin`` will often get you where you need to go faster.

csvstack: combining subsets
===========================

Frequently large datasets are distributed in many small files. At some point you will probably want to merge those files for aggregate analysis. :doc:`/scripts/csvstack` allows you to "stack" the rows from CSV files with identical headers. To demonstrate, let's imagine we've decided that Nebraska and Kansas form a "region" and that it would be useful to analyze them in a single dataset. Let's grab the Kansas data::

    $ curl -L -O https://github.com/onyxfish/csvkit/raw/master/examples/realdata/ks_1033_data.csvstack

Now let's stack these two data files::

    $ csvstack ne_1033_data.csv ks_1033_data.csv > region.csv

Using csvstat we cansee that our ``region.csv`` contains both datasets::

    $ csvstat -c state,acquisition_cost region.csv
      1. state
            <type 'unicode'>
            Nulls: False
            Values: KS, NE
      8. acquisition_cost
            <type 'float'>
            Nulls: False
            Min: 0.0
            Max: 658000.0
            Sum: 9447912.36
            Mean: 3618.50339334
            Median: 138.0
            Standard Deviation: 23725.9555723
            Unique values: 127
            5 most frequent values:
                    120.0:  649
                    499.0:  449
                    138.0:  311
                    6800.0: 304
                    58.71:  218

    Row count: 2611

If you supply the ``-g`` flag then ``csvstack`` can also add a "grouping column" to each row, so that you can tell which file each row came from. In this case we don't need this, but you can imagine a situation in which instead of having a ``county`` column each of this datasets had simply been named ``nebraska.csv`` and ``kansas.csv``. In that case, using a grouping column would prevent us from losing information when we stacked them.

csvsql and sql2csv: ultimate power
==================================

Sometimes (almost always), the command line isn't enough. It would be crazy to try to do all your analysis using command line tools. Often times, the correct tool for data analysis is SQL. :doc:`/scripts/csvsql` and :doc:`/scripts/sql2csv` form a bridge that eases migrating your data into and out of a SQL database. For smaller datasets ``csvsql`` can also leverage `sqlite <https://www.sqlite.org/>`_ to allow execution of ad hoc SQL queries without ever touching a database.

By default, ``csvsql`` will generate a create table statement for your data. You can specify what sort of database you are using with the ``-i`` flag::

    $ csvsql -i sqlite joined.csv
    CREATE TABLE joined (
            state VARCHAR(2) NOT NULL,
            county VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
            fips INTEGER NOT NULL,
            nsn VARCHAR(16) NOT NULL,
            item_name VARCHAR(62) NOT NULL,
            quantity VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL,
            ui VARCHAR(7) NOT NULL,
            acquisition_cost FLOAT NOT NULL,
            total_cost VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
            ship_date DATE NOT NULL,
            federal_supply_category VARCHAR(34) NOT NULL,
            federal_supply_category_name VARCHAR(35) NOT NULL,
            federal_supply_class VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,
            federal_supply_class_name VARCHAR(63),
            name VARCHAR(21) NOT NULL,
            total_population INTEGER NOT NULL,
            margin_of_error INTEGER NOT NULL
    );

Here we have the sqlite "create table" statement for our joined data. You'll see that, like ``csvstat``, ``csvsql`` has done it's best to infer the column types.

Often you won't care about storing the SQL statements locally. You can also use ``csvsql`` to create the table directly in the database on your local machine. If you add the ``--insert`` option the data will also be imported::

    $ csvsql --db sqlite:///leso.db --insert joined.csv

How can we check that our data was imported successfully? We could use the sqlite command line interface, but rather than worry about the specifics of another tool, we can also use ``sql2csv``::

    $ sql2csv --db sqlite:///leso.db --query "select * from joined"

Note that the ``--query`` parameter to ``sql2csv`` accepts any SQL query. For example, to export Douglas county from the ``joined`` table from our sqlite database, we would run::

    $ sql2csv --db sqlite:///leso.db --query "select * from joined where county='DOUGLAS';" > douglas.csv

Sometimes, if you will only be running a single query, even constructing the database is a waste of time. For that case, you can actually skip the database entirely and ``csvsql`` will create one in memory for you::

    $ csvsql --query "select county,item_name from joined where quantity > 5;" joined.csv | csvlook

SQL queries directly on CSVs! Keep in mind when using this that you are loading the entire dataset into an in-memory database, so it is likely to be very slow for large datasets.

Summing up
==========

``csvjoin``, ``csvstack``, ``csvsql`` and ``sql2csv`` represent the power tools of csvkit. Using this tools can vastly simplify processes that would otherwise require moving data between other systems. But what about cases where these tools still don't cut it? What if you need to move your data onto the web or into a legacy database system? We've got a few solutions for those problems in our final section, :doc:`4_going_elsewhere`.
