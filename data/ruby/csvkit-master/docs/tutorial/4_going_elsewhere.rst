csvjson: going online
=====================

Very frequently one of the last steps in any data analysis is to get the data onto the web for display as a table, map or chart. CSV is rarely the ideal format for this. More often than not what you want is JSON and that's where :doc:`/scripts/csvjson` comes in. ``csvjson`` takes an input CSV and outputs neatly formatted JSON. For the sake of illustration, let's use ``csvcut`` and ``csvgrep`` to convert just a small slice of our data::

    $ csvcut -c county,item_name data.csv | csvgrep -c county -m "GREELEY" | csvjson --indent 4 
    [
        {
            "county": "GREELEY",
            "item_name": "RIFLE,7.62 MILLIMETER"
        },
        {
            "county": "GREELEY",
            "item_name": "RIFLE,7.62 MILLIMETER"
        },
        {
            "county": "GREELEY",
            "item_name": "RIFLE,7.62 MILLIMETER"
        }
    ]

A common usage of turning a CSV into a JSON file is for usage as a lookup table in the browser. This can be illustrated with the ACS data we looked at earlier, which contains a unique ``fips`` code for each county::

    $ csvjson --indent 4 --key fips acs2012_5yr_population.csv | head
    {
        "31001": {
            "fips": "31001",
            "name": "Adams County, NE",
            "total_population": "31299",
            "margin_of_error": "0"
        },
        "31003": {
            "fips": "31003",
            "name": "Antelope County, NE",

For those making maps, ``csvjson`` can also output GeoJSON, see its :doc:`documentation </scripts/csvjson>` for more details.

csvpy: going into code
======================

For the programmers out there, the command line is rarely as functional as just writing a little bit of code. :doc:`/scripts/csvpy` exists just to make a programmer's life easier. Invoking it simply launches a Python interactive terminal, with the data preloaded into a CSV reader::

    $ csvpy data.csv
    Welcome! "data.csv" has been loaded in a CSVKitReader object named "reader".
    >>> print len(list(reader))
    1037
    >>> quit()

In addition to being a time-saver, because this uses csvkit's internal :class:`CSVKitReader` the reader is Unicode aware.

csvformat: for legacy systems
=============================

It is a foundational principle of csvkit that it always outputs cleanly formatted CSV data. None of the normal csvkit tools can be forced to produce pipe or tab-delimited output, despite these being common formats. This principle is what allows the csvkit tools to chain together so easily and hopefully also reduces the amount of crummy, non-standard CSV files in the world. However, sometimes a legacy system just has to have a pipe-delimited file and it would be crazy to make you use another tool to create it. That's why we've got :doc:`/scripts/csvformat`.

Pipe-delimited::

    $ csvformat -D \| data.csv

Tab-delimited::

    $ csvformat -T data.csv

Quote every cell::

    $ csvformat -U 1 data.csv

Ampersand-delimited, dollar-signs for quotes, quote all strings, and asterisk for line endings::

    $ csvformat -D \& -Q \$ -U 2 -M \* data.csv

You get the picture.

Summing up
==========

Thus concludes the csvkit tutorial. At this point, I hope, you have a sense a breadth of possibilities these tools open up with a relative small number of command line tools. Of course, this tutorial has only scratched the surface of the available options, so remember to check the documentation for each tool as well.

So armed, go forth and expand the empire of the king of tabular file formats.
